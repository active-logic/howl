# Development workflow

## Installation

Clone the repository and run `./setup` or `./setup.ps1`; this will install the CLI and is identical to the 'one line end user install'.

Howl is written in *Cosmo*; ensure you have installed *Atom* and the *language-howl* extensions.

## Common tasks

```
cd howl
howl build src  # build the CLI
howl test .     # build and run tests
howl run src    # run the CLI
```

## Updating and reverting [TODO: macOS only for now]

Once you feel a change is ready for local use:

```
howl install .  # Build in Release mode and symlink binaries
```

Have a change of heart? `./setup` restores the CLI to the latest release.
